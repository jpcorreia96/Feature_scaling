#  Data Normalization and Histogram Plotting

This project demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing, specifically focusing on normalization, and how to visualize the effect of normalization using histograms. Proper data preprocessing is a critical step in any data analysis or machine learning project as it ensures the data is in a suitable format for modeling.

## Importance of Data Preprocessing
### Data Quality Improvement
* Consistency: Ensures that the data is consistent, making it easier to identify and handle outliers and missing values.
* Accuracy: Reduces errors and improves the accuracy of the data by eliminating inconsistencies and noise.
* Completeness: Addresses missing values, ensuring that the dataset is complete and reliable for analysis.

### Performance Enhancement of Models
* Better Learning: Models train more effectively on well-preprocessed data, leading to better performance and faster convergence.
* Reduced Overfitting: Proper preprocessing helps in reducing overfitting, enhancing the model's ability to generalize on unseen data.

### Feature Extraction
* Relevance: Helps in extracting relevant features, improving the model's predictive power.
* Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifies the data by reducing the number of features, making the model more interpretable and less computationally expensive.

### Compatibility Facilitation
* Uniformity: Ensures that data from different sources and formats can be combined and used together effectively.
* Standardization: Facilitates the use of common scales and formats, making it easier to integrate and compare datasets.

### Efficiency Increase

* Computational Efficiency: Streamlines data processing, reducing the computational load and improving processing speed.
* Automation: Enables the automation of data preprocessing steps, saving time and resources.

## Normalization
Normalization is the process of scaling the data to a specific range, usually [0, 1]. This is useful when the features have different ranges, and you want to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the model.

## Standardization
Standardization transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is particularly useful when the data follows a Gaussian distribution and is essential for algorithms that assume this distribution.
